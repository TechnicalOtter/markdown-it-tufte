## Under Construction

The CI and NPM links will be updated as the library stabilizes!

## To-Do List

- [x] Complete side-note/margin-note implementation (specifically, the `{-}` prefix)
- [ ] Automatically split `<section>`s, based on `newthought`s and `h2`s
- [x] Change `newthought` to requiring a double caret `^^` delimiter (maybe?)

Most likely, once the above items are complete, we'll do the first NPM-published package.
There are plenty of "post-release" items to consider though:

- [ ] Syntax for `<figure>`s
- [ ] Epigraph-style block quotes, and `<footer>` citations
